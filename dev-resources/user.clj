(comment
  "This user namespace exists to make it a bit easier to (manually)
  test that the log event is being encoded correctly. To do that, try
  this:

  - Fire up an instance of Riemann on your local machine. You'll
    probably want a really minimal number of streams, possibly as
    little as a single `prn`
  - Start up a REPL in this project
  - Use `(ship-event)` above to ship events to Riemann" )
